Parallel Stack
The Stack class satisfies LIFO (last in first out) property, and provides push() and
pop() methods. Despite of synchronization of push and pop operations, stacks are not
inherently sequential, they do not provide little opportunity for concurrency.
In this repository, we designed and implemented Elimination Back-off Stack algorithm in Java.
